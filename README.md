# HFT-trainer
A repository with different mini-projects illustrating several concepts of High Frequency Trading. I plan to learn by building solutions to well-known problems and benchmarking them.

I will try my best to employ best practices and "header-only" modern-c++ metaprogramming philosophy!


# Project Structure
- **utils**: Here I will place random utility code that I think is useful/interesting even if I haven't used it in any projects yet. I will gradually move them as they evolve or fit in a certain place.
    - *nano_money.hpp* -> Implementation of a numeric class (Fixed<int Decimals>) that allows you to perform operations on uint64\_t as if they were double, without the IEEE 754 rounding problems.  
- **examples**: Home of some practical uses of the code I will be developing.
